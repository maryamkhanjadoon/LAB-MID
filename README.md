Shopping Assistant is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to search for item prices across different stores by simply entering the item name. Built using Java Swing for the graphical interface and MySQL for data storage, the system follows a clean MVC architecture. The frontend (SearchUI.java) handles user input and displays results, while the backend (QueryManager.java, Item.java, and DBConnection.java) manages database connections and queries. GRASP principles like Controller, Information Expert, and Low Coupling were applied to ensure a modular and maintainable design. This application helps users compare prices efficiently and can be easily extended with features like barcode or image search.
